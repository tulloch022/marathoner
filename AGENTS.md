# Marathoner Working Agreement

## Project context

Marathoner is a React and TypeScript application built with Vite. It currently
uses Firebase for authentication and data-related services.

- `src/App.tsx`: top-level application composition
- `src/components/`: reusable UI and feature components
- `src/services/`: integrations and application services
- `src/firebaseConfig.ts`: Firebase initialization
- `src/index.css`: shared application styling

## Development commands

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start the development server: `npm run dev`
- Run linting: `npm run lint`
- Run the automated test suite: `npm test`
- Run tests while developing: `npm run test:watch`
- Run the production build and TypeScript checks: `npm run build`
- Preview the production build: `npm run preview`

## Collaboration approach

The maintainer is developing this project outside of their day job and wants to
understand every line they commit.

- Scope work into a focused 60-90 minute daily slice whenever practical.
- Before editing, briefly explain the intended behavior, files involved, and
  verification plan.
- Prefer teaching and plain-language explanations over unexplained code output.
- Keep changes small, cohesive, and tied to the active GitHub issue.
- Avoid unrelated refactors, speculative abstractions, and drive-by cleanup.
- Call out assumptions and meaningful tradeoffs before they shape the solution.
- Explain new dependencies before adding them.
- Preserve existing user changes, including uncommitted work.
- Do not commit, push, create branches, or change GitHub state unless explicitly
  requested.

## Required GitHub workflow

- Start every change from an existing open GitHub issue.
- Create a dedicated branch from an up-to-date `main`. When Codex creates the
  branch, use `codex/issue-<number>-<short-description>`.
- Never commit directly to or push directly to `main`.
- Open a pull request for every repository change, including documentation and
  configuration changes.
- Include `Closes #<issue-number>`, `Fixes #<issue-number>`, or
  `Resolves #<issue-number>` in the pull request body.
- Do not merge until required checks pass and all review conversations are
  resolved.
- Required approving reviews remain at zero while this is a solo repository.
  The maintainer performs the final diff review and merge. Raise the rule to one
  approving review after a collaborator is added.

## Code expectations

- Follow the existing strict TypeScript and ESLint configuration.
- Prefer clear React function components and descriptive names.
- Keep data access and external integrations in service modules when practical.
- Match existing project conventions unless the task intentionally improves them.
- Never expose credentials or commit environment secrets.

## Definition of done

For implementation work:

1. Confirm the requested behavior and acceptance criteria are satisfied.
2. Run `npm run lint`.
3. Run `npm test`.
4. Run `npm run build`.
5. Manually exercise affected UI behavior with `npm run dev` when relevant.
6. Review the final diff for regressions and unrelated changes.
7. Summarize what changed, why it changed, and any remaining verification gaps.

If a check cannot be run or fails for a pre-existing reason, report that clearly
instead of treating the work as fully verified.
